# SuccessionDown

---------

## Tethered Downgrades

Either compile and install yourself or add my [repo](matthewpierson.github.io) and install it from there

This fork is purely for tethered downgrades! This is likely very unstable, probably won't work and might damage your device. It will probably be fine but be warned. 

To perform a tethered downgrade using this, simply open the app, click "Download clean filesystem", enter what iOS version you wish to downgrade to and let it do it's stuff!

You are still restricted by SEP compatibility, which the app will check after you input an iOS version. The app will also not let non-checkm8 devices nuke their iOS install by running this.

Apple is still blocking older IPSW downloads, seemingly at random, so if you are unable to download one iOS version either try again, wait a few hours and try again or pick a different iOS version. 

DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT annoy/message/spam/question Samg_is_a_Ninja about any issues that occur with this fork, please direct all of them to me as I don't want him to have to deal with the various issues this fork will likely have. Either on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mosk_i) or here on GitHub.

Alternative to Cydia Eraser that is much easier to update. Downloads and mounts rootfilesystem DMG for your iOS version. Then moves files from mounted DMG to the main filesystem.

## Compiling

*I really dont anticipate that anyone will ever attempt to compile this project... but... here goes* ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Requires macOS, and probably a fairly recent version of it. 

Requires `fakeroot`, `ldid`, and `dpkg`. If you dont have them already, they can be easily installed using [homebrew](https://brew.sh):

`brew install fakeroot`

`brew install ldid`

`brew install dpkg`

You may need to edit "succdatroot/Makefile" and change the theos directory from "~/.theos" to "$THEOS" or where ever you have Theos setup. Also edit "compile" and change the IP address to your device's. 

You will need a fairly recent version of theos set up, you can follow their install tutorial [here](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation-macOS)

Compiling is fairly simple afterwards, thanks to the `compile` script provided in the root directory of the project. You can use it to compile and install Succession directly onto your device.

***Note**: The install part of the `compile` script will only work if you have OpenSSH installed on your iOS device.*
